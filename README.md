# ChatGPT-AWS-Deployer Plugin

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a powerful ChatGPT plugin designed to interact with AWS for application deployment purposes. The plugin incorporates DevOps methodologies and automates the deployment process through a user-friendly chat interface. It initiates a comprehensive set of activities including security checks, unit tests, and integration tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the deployed applications.

The plugin currently supports serverless technologies in AWS, but it is built with extensibility in mind and we plan to include other AWS services in future releases.

## Features

* User-friendly interface for application deployment
